Program Description:
--------------------
This program allows the user to build their own dataset of images extracted from
Google Images. Expect the data to be as good as Google Images can be. This
program is meant just for prototypes or other cases where you need large amounts
of data and quality of images is not a priority.

Installation:
-------------
#TODO put it up in GitHub

Usage:
------
1) To execute the program enter the following command:

  '$ ./get_data.sh' or '$ bash get_data.sh'

2) This will promt the following message:

  ######################################################################################
  
   Welcome!
   This program will allow you to create your own dataset extracted from Google images.
   USAGE: Just help us out with the following information and we'll do the rest.
   RECOMMENDATIONS: Look up the query beforehand in Google Images.
   NOTE: Expect the quality of the images to be as good as a Google Images search.
  
  ######################################################################################

3) The program will ask you to specify the following information:
  - The search query.
  - The format of the images.
  - If you want to include related images.
  - The limit of images per category.
  - (if the user decided to include related images) Max number of related 
  categories.

4) The program will now ask for confirmation before initializing the download.
After reviewing the summary, if the user decides to continue then type "y",
otherwise, enter "n".

5) Now the program will go a series of automated processes which might take a
few minutes depending of how many images you've specified. Once finished, the
program will output the PATH to the folder where the dataset is found. 

The name of your dataset will have the following pattern: "*FORMAT*_*QUERY*".
Inside the folder you will find:
  - A download log.
  - Folders categorized accordingly with their search queries.
  - A folder named "total" containing all the images for easy manipualtion.
  - A .tar file containing all the images.

Note:
-----
The user can run several instances of this script at the same time.
Please execute this program in the directory where the script is.
